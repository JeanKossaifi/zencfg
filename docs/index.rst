Why ZenCFG?
-----------

ZenCFG (for *Zen ConFiGuration*), is the result of many iterations of trying pretty much every existing approach to Python configuration management systems and being satisfied by none of them. 

The key advantages of ZenCFG are:

**1. Native Python Tooling**
Work with configs like any other Python codeâ€”inheritance, composition, and type hints provide familiar development patterns.
This also means full IDE support with autocomplete, refactoring safety, and type checking.

**2. Reduced Debugging Time** 
Catch configuration errors at startup with type safety and runtime validation, not hours into expensive training runs.

**3. Quick and Flexible Experimentation**
Override any nested parameter through intuitive command-line syntax without file editing. 
Switch between model architectures, optimizers, and their specific parameters in a single command.

**4. Zero Boilerplate**
Pure Python classes with no frameworks, no special syntax, and no additional dependencies. If you know Python, you know ZenCFG.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install zencfg
